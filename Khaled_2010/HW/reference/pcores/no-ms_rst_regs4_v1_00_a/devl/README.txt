*                         3) Description of Used IPIC Signals                  *
================================================================================
For more information (usage, timing diagrams, etc.) regarding the IPIC signals
used in the templates, please refer to the following specifications (under
%XILINX_EDK%\doc for windows or $XILINX_EDK/doc for solaris and linux):
proc_ip_ref_guide.pdf - Processor IP Reference Guide (chapter 4 IPIF)
user_core_templates_ref_guide.pdf - User Core Templates Reference Guide

Bus2IP_Clk
    This is the clock input to the user logic. All IPIC signals are synchronous 
    to this clock. It is identical to the <bus>_Clk signal that is an input to 
    the user core. In an OPB core, Bus2IP_Clk is the same as OPB_Clk, and in a 
    PLB core, it is the same as PLB_Clk. No additional buffering is provided on 
    the clock; it is passed through as is. 

Bus2IP_Reset
    Signal to reset the User Logic; asserts whenever the <bus>_Rst signal does 
    and, if the Reset block is included, whenever there is a software-programmed 
    reset. 

Bus2IP_Data
    This is the data bus from the IPIF to the user logic; it is used for both 
    master and slave transactions. It is used to access user logic registers. 

Bus2IP_BE
    The Bus2IP_BE is a bus of Byte Enable qualifiers from the IPIF to the user 
    logic. A bit in the Bus2IP_BE set to '1' indicates that the associated byte 
    lane contains valid data. For example, if Bus2IP_BE = 0011, this indicates 
    that byte lanes 2 and 3 contains valid data. 

Bus2IP_RdCE
    The Bus2IP_RdCE bus is an input to the user logic. It is Bus2IP_CE qualified 
    by a read transaction. 

Bus2IP_WrCE
    The Bus2IP_WrCE bus is an input to the user logic. It is Bus2IP_CE qualified 
    by a write transaction. 

Bus2IP_RdReq
    The Bus2IP_RdReq signal is an input to the user logic indicating that the 
    requested transaction is a read transfer. Normally you don't have to use the 
    Bus2IP_RdReq signal. 

Bus2IP_WrReq
    The Bus2IP_WrReq signal is an input to the user logic indicating that the 
    requested transaction is a write transfer. Normally you don't have to use 
    the Bus2IP_WrReq signal, except in the burst write transaction, you need to 
    check on Bus2IP_WrReq for data validity. PLB IPIF incorporate a write buffer 
    for burst to solve some timing issue, which causes the data to be valid 2~3 
    cycles after the CS/CE/RNW signals are asserted, so only when Bus2IP_WrReq 
    is asserted that means data is valid. 

IP2Bus_Data
    This is the data bus from the user logic to the IPIF; it is used for both 
    master and slave transactions. It is used to access user logic registers. 

IP2Bus_Retry
    IP2Bus_Retry is a response from the user logic to the IPIF that indicates 
    the currently requested transaction cannot be completed at this time and 
    that the requesting master should retry the operation. If the IP2Bus_Retry 
    signal will be delayed more than 8 clocks, then the IP2Bus_ToutSup (timeout 
    suppress) signal must also be asserted to prevent a timeout on the host bus. 
    Note: this signal is unused by PLB IPIF. 

IP2Bus_Error
    This signal from the user logic to the IPIF indicates an error has occurred 
    during the current transaction. It is valid when IP2Bus_Ack is asserted. 

IP2Bus_ToutSup
    The IP2Bus_ToutSup must be asserted by the user logic whenever its 
    acknowledgement or retry response will take longer than 8 clock cycles. 

IP2Bus_RdAck
    The IP2Bus_RdAck signal provide the read acknowledgement from the user logic 
    to the IPIF. It indicates that valid data is available. For immediate 
    acknowledgement (such as for a register read), this signal can be tied to 
    '1'. Wait states can be inserted in the transaction by delaying the 
    assertion of the acknowledgement. 

IP2Bus_WrAck
    The IP2Bus_WrAck signal provide the write acknowledgement from the user 
    logic to the IPIF. It indicates the data has been taken by the user logic. 
    For immediate acknowledgement (such as for a register write), this signal 
    can be tied to '1'. Wait states can be inserted in the transaction by 
    delaying the assertion of the acknowledgement. 

Bus2IP_MstError
    The Bus2IP_MstError signal from the IPIF to the user logic indicates whether 
    the transfer has an error. The signal is valid during the cycle that 
    Bus2IP_MstLastAck is active. Note: a burst transaction reporting an error 
    may have terminated prematurely. 

Bus2IP_MstLastAck
    Bus2IP_MstLastAck is a one-cycle acknowledgement of a master transaction 
    from the IPIF to the user logic. A transaction may consist of multiple 
    transfers (burst transaction); Bus2IP_MstLastAck will always accompany the 
    last Bus2IP_MstAck for the transaction. 

Bus2IP_MstRdAck
    This is a one-cycle acknowledgement of a master transfer from the IPIF to 
    the user logic. It indicates that valid data is present on the Bus2IP_Data 
    bus. 

Bus2IP_MstWrAck
    This is a one-cycle acknowledgement of a master transfer from the IPIF to 
    the user logic. It indicates that the IPIF has accepted the current data and 
    is ready for the next data. 

Bus2IP_MstRetry
    Bus2IP_MstRetry is a one-cycle alternative completion signal to 
    Bus2IP_MstLastAck. It indicates that the requested transaction could not be 
    performed but may succeed if retried; if IP2Bus_MstReq remains asserted in 
    the following cycle, the IPIF will retry the transaction and may reuse any 
    state that it has built up in support of the transaction (the user logic 
    must leave addresses and transaction qualification signals unchanged). If 
    otherwise the request signal is deasserted on the following cycle and the 
    transaction is considered abandoned from the point of view of the IPIF. 

Bus2IP_MstTimeOut
    Bus2IP_MstTimeOut (from the IPIF to the user logic) is a one-cycle 
    alternative completion signal to Bus2IP_MstLastAck. It indicates that the 
    requested transaction could not be performed within the timeout interval 
    associated with the host bus. 

IP2Bus_Addr
    IP2Bus_Addr is an output from the user logic to the IPIF. It is the address 
    bus for the current master transaction. It is valid when IP2Bus_Req is 
    active. 

IP2Bus_MstBE
    IP2Bus_MstBE is a bus of Byte Enables qualifiers from the user logic to the 
    IPIF for a master transaction. A bit in the IP2Bus_MstBE set to '1' 
    indicates that the associated byte lane contains valid data. For example, if 
    IP2Bus_MstBE = 0011, this indicates that byte lanes 2 and 3 contain valid 
    data. 

IP2Bus_MstBurst
    The IP2Bus_MstBurst qualifier from the user logic to the IPIC indicates the 
    master transaction is a burst operation. 

IP2Bus_MstBusLock
    The IP2Bus_MstBusLock qualifier from the user logic to the IPIC indicates 
    the master is requesting that the host bus be locked until IP2Bus_MstBusLock 
    is deasserted. The assertion of IP2Bus_MstBusLock must accompany a master 
    request, and can be deasserted at any time. 

IP2Bus_MstRdReq
    IP2Bus_MstRdReq is input to the IPIF from the user logic that indicates that 
    the user logic is requesting a master transaction (read). This request 
    signal must remain asserted until acknowledged by Bus2IP_MstLastAck, 
    Bus2IP_Retry, or Bus2IP_TimeOut. 

IP2Bus_MstWrReq
    IP2Bus_MstWrReq is input to the IPIF from the user logic that indicates that 
    the user logic is requesting a master transaction (write). This request 
    signal must remain asserted until acknowledged by Bus2IP_MstLastAck, 
    Bus2IP_Retry, or Bus2IP_TimeOut. 

IP2IP_Addr
    The IP2IP_Addr signal is an output from the user logic that indicates the 
    local device address for the master transaction. This address will be the 
    source for a master write transaction and the sink for a master read 
    transaction. This is used only in bus peripherals that are both master and 
    slave and the master requires access to the slave devices to perform master 
    operations. An example is a master that must read from a local memory and 
    then write that data to the host bus. In this case IP2IP_Addr is used to 
    address the local memory that provides the data for the write.

*                     4) Description of Top Level Generics                     *
================================================================================
C_BASEADDR/C_HIGHADDR
    These two generics are used to define the memory mapped address space for
    the peripheral registers, including Reset/MIR register, Interrupt Source
    Controller registers, Read/Write FIFO control/data registers, user logic
    software accessible registers and etc., but excluding those user logic
    address ranges if ever used. When instantiation, the address space size
    determined by these two generics must be a power of 2 (e.g. 2^k =
    C_HIGHADDR - C_BASEADDR + 1), a factor of C_BASEADDR and larger than the
    minimum size as indicated in the template.

C_OPB_DWIDTH
    This is the data bus width for On-chip Peripheral Bus (OPB). It should
    always be set to 32 as of today.

C_OPB_AWIDTH
    This is the address bus width for On-chip Peripheral Bus (OPB). It should
    always be set to 32 as of today.

C_USER_ID_CODE
    This is the ID that will be put into the MIR register, it's mainly used
    for debug purpose to identify the peripheral under test if multiple
    instances exist in the system.

C_FAMILY
    This is to set the target FPGA architecture, s.t. virtex2, virtex2p, etc.
