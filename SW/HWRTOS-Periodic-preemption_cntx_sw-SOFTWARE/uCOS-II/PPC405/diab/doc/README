    Public Domain Release of the MicroC/OS port to PPC 405GP.

The files in this release contain v2.00 release of the MicroC/OS
that has been ported to the PowerPC 405GP Microcontroller. The
port has been tested on the IBM Walnut Evaluation board based on
the Revision C of the processor.

The Diab tools (Rel 4.3 Rev f) was used to build the kernel and 
other files. At the post linking stage tools to get a flat image
file (*.img) The .img file can be directly loaded into the 
Walnut board from the ROM monitor on Walnut.

PPC 405GP has several onchip peripherals. The current release of the
port has not enabled support for all the peripherals. Support for
the 2 UART channels is provided. UART0 can be used as a console port.
UART1 can be used as a serial I/O port. It is planned to support
the other peripherals in the next release.

This distribution contains ONLY the PowerPC port code.  It is
expected that the user will have acquired the code for the UCOS-II
kernel and the associated manual from Jean J. Labrosse, Weston, FL
Jean.Labrosse@uCOS-II.com . See http://www.ucos-ii.com for details.

Note:
----
The source directory contains the MicroC/OS v2.0 cpu independent files.
You can have this ported to a new version of the OS simply by 
having the path to the new OS independent files defined for UCOSDIR 
in the makefile.

How to build and load:
---------------------
1. Extract the package 
   - extract using tar -xvf <package>.tar or unzip <package>.zip.
   - package is extacted to software/ucos-ii/PPC405/diab/ 
2. Set the environment variable DIABPATH to the path where the diab
   tools can be found.
   Example: In csh, 
   setenv DIABPATH path_to_diab_tools
3. Ensure that you have atleast Rel 4.3 Rev f version of the diab tools.
   dcc -V and das -V
4. Set the UCOSDIR variable in the makefile to point to the path to
   the processor independent files.
5. type 'make'
6. The final image ucosppc.elf and ucosppc.img is obtained.
7. If you use walnut board, ucosppc.img can be loaded using the walnut
   boot monitor.
